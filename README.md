This is a bot for Starcraft 2 using the PySC2 library. My ultimate goal is to write a fully-featured bot and explore the best learning methods to teach it to play ladder matches.
<p>Currently this bot is based on skjb's excellent tutorials for writing a bot (https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial). It's based on his newest tutorial for building a Zerg bot, but with modifications to make it a Terran bot.</p>
<p>Current tasks: Need to hook up the q-learning code, as well as add more actions for the bot to take.</p>
<p>Near future tasks: Test out the learning code on the Deepmind-provided mini-games to experiment with different reward schemes.</p>
<p>Farther-out tasks: Break down aspects of the games such as combat (micro), resource gathering, build orders, and scouting and experiment with learning methods to create loadable modules for each aspect to deal with changes in game state.</p>
